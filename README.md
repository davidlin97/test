It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com) or http://google.com

_You **can** combine them_
**_xxddxx_**

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

- 1
- 2
  - 3
  - 4
    - 5
    - 6
      -7
      -8

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.
